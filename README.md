Module 12

## **Project Overview**

Many bacteria are not well studied while many more are unknown to science. Luckily, the human body is a vast ecosystem of thousands of types of bacteria that vary from person to person. Our goal is to find bacteria that simulates the taste of beef and what better place to look than within the human bellybutton? This dashboard aims to provide insight to our current research for both our team and our participants. We will accomplish this by using a mix of html, plot.ly, and JavaScript to manipulate data from our JSON file and display it in a meaningful way on the website.

## Summary
The aim of this website will allow research participants and reserchers an easy-to-use way to interface with the data captured and provide meaningful insight to what will be studied.
